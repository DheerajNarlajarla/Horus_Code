# Horus Code Project - Context Instructions

This file contains instructions on how to provide context about the Horus Code project to AI assistants in future conversations.

## Quick Context Method

For a quick reminder, you can simply provide this information at the beginning of your conversation:

"We were working on the Horus Code project (https://github.com/DheerajNarlajarla/Horus_Code.git) where we created three custom VS Code themes (HorusCode, BorealisIDE, and BloodCode) and streamlined the build scripts to build_portable.bat and build_installer.bat. The output directories are now horus_portable and horus_installer."

## Detailed Context Method

For more detailed context, you can upload the chat.txt file at the beginning of your conversation. This file contains:

1. The complete development journey
2. Code samples for all components
3. Detailed explanations of each step
4. Build script information
5. Testing approaches
6. Final solution details

## GitHub Repository Method

You can also provide the GitHub repository URL:
https://github.com/DheerajNarlajarla/Horus_Code.git

This allows the AI to see all the code and changes we've made.

## Key Information to Include

When providing context, make sure to mention:

1. **Project Name**: Horus Code
2. **Theme Names**: 
   - HorusCode (Egyptian theme with gold accents)
   - BorealisIDE (Northern Lights theme with blues and teals)
   - BloodCode (Dark Gore theme with Oxblood Red and Pitch Black)
3. **Build Scripts**:
   - build_portable.bat (creates portable version in horus_portable directory)
   - build_installer.bat (creates installer in horus_installer directory)
   - build_linux.sh (for future Linux support)
4. **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/DheerajNarlajarla/Horus_Code.git

## Example Prompt

Here's an example of how to start a new conversation:

"I'm continuing work on the Horus Code project (https://github.com/DheerajNarlajarla/Horus_Code.git). We previously created three custom VS Code themes (HorusCode, BorealisIDE, and BloodCode) and streamlined the build scripts. I've run the build_portable.bat script and would like to discuss [specific topic or issue]."

## Uploading the chat.txt File

To upload the chat.txt file:
1. Look for an upload or attachment option in the chat interface
2. Select the chat.txt file from c:\Users\dheer\Documents\IDE\my-custom-vscode\chat.txt
3. Once uploaded, mention that the file contains the complete development history of the project

This will provide the AI assistant with comprehensive context about the Horus Code project and allow for a seamless continuation of your work.
